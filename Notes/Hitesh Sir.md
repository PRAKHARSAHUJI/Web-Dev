- DNS - DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM
- IP - INTERNET PROTOCOL
- ISP - INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER 



Google, Azure, AWS, Digitalocean DO, lineode are the the big computer which are (up and running) always on to host the website of yours 


Firstly we connect with our ISP (Airtel, Jio, and all) ans type website we need to search  We type the website name then it goes to to search the IP address what is of that website (IP means like who is the owner) Then it goes to domain name system DNS and then search the IP address of the  lookup website through some NSLOOKUP, then it give the IP Address to ISP then it searches the IP address on internet then internet finds the website and give back to the system

## Big Picture of WEB APPLICATION


1. When we request one website from our browser the server (SERVER is connected with the database like if we login it checks that is it true for example when we login database checks the records and matches the passwords) responds with the HTML (Structure of the website HYPER TEXT MARKUP LANG) some texts, some headings and paragraphs 

2. After that comes CSS (Cascading style sheet) it make a things little more beautiful add the colours to the website

3. Finally the functionality part of the application comes with the JAVASCRIPT (search features, ability to click the button, something happens when you click the button ), ONE important job also of JS to take some information from your browser to the server

## SOME IMPORTANT THINGS TO LEARN 

- FRONTEND
- BACKEND
- APIs
- CLIENT SERVER ARCHITECHURE



SERVER is just a software. A Software that serves it web application. It is termed as BACKEND.(Also comprises of DATABASE and more such things)
BACKEND comprise of two things one thing is

1. PROGRAMMING Language (Javascript)  (NODE JS, PHP, DJango, Python, RUBY on RAILS all are server side scripting language)

1. DATABASE  (MONGODB, MYSQL, POSTGRES)


FRONTEND is that which a browser renders on it (HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT) and there are some more frameworks/ libraries that are introduced to it (TAILWIND - these are just a versions of CSS, BOOTSTRAP) Similar javascript some more tech come into to the picture to make things easy (REACT, VIEW, SVELTE all have foundation JAVASCRIPT) 

API - Application programming interface It is a medium through which frontend and backend are interacting with each other. IF a backend is written in java and frontend in javascript so we need common language which they can talk to each other then api comes into the picture then frontend makes the request to the API endpoint (example like for signup) then it sends the data in UNIVERALLY ACCEPTED FORMAT that is JSON also the backend also send back the data in JSON format or the accepted format for API
